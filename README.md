# Energy Efficiency for Buildings

This is a personal data science project focused on energy efficiency for building sustainability with the implementation of gradient boosting regression using scikit-learn packages. The model is trained to predict the heating and cooling loads of a building given a dataset of building parameters. This project utilized a dataset obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, comprising 768 samples and 8 features.
