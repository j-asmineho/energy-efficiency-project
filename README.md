# Energy Efficiency Project

#This is a personal data science project focused on energy efficiency for building sustainability with the implementation of gradient boosting regression using scikit-learn packages. The model is trained to predict the heating and cooling loads of a building given a dataset of building parameters. This project utilized a dataset obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, comprising 768 samples and 8 features. This project showcases my ability to leverage machine learning techniques, specifically gradient boosting regression, to solve real-world problems related to energy efficiency. It demonstrates my proficiency in data analysis, model development, and effective communication of results.
